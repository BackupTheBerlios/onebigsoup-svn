  Welcome to the Local Names project!


  Let's get you started!

  1. Go to the "lncore" directory, and set things up.

       cd "$ONEBIGSOUP/lncore"
       python setup.py install

  2. Create a directory somewhere.

       DIR_QUERYSERVER="/tmp/queryserver"
       mkdir "$DIR_QUERYSERVER"

  3. Copy in the following files:

       cp "$ONEBIGSOUP/other/xrserve/xrserve.py" "$DIR_QUERYSERVER"
       cp "$ONEBIGSOUP/lnresolve/lnxrqs.py" "$DIR_QUERYSERVER"

  4. Run the query server!

       cd "$DIR_QUERYSERVER"
       python 2.3 xrserve.py --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000

  5. Hit it with a web browser!

       http://localhost:8000/

     You should see the query server interface.

  6. Hit it with Python!

       Python 2.4.1 (#65, Mar 30 2005, 09:13:57)...
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more...
       >>> import xmlrpclib
       >>> import pprint
       >>> server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
       >>> pprint.pprint(server.lnquery.get_server_info())
       {'CACHE': [],
        'IMPLEMENTATION': 'OBS-LNQS',
        'INTERFACE': 'v1 Local Names Query Interface',
        'STYLES': [['traditional',
                    'This is the normal way of resolving names,
       described in the Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface
       specification.']]}
       >>>

  7. Are you connected to the Internet, and have a namespace description
     out there somewhere? If so, try this!

       >>> server.lnquery.lookup("http://example.net/namespace.txt",
                                 "foo")  # term to look up
       [0, 'http://example.com/foo/bar/baz/']

     (NOTE: If **not**, follow the steps in Addendum A, at the end of
            this tutorial, and then come back here.
            Use your "Namespace Description URL" in place of
            "http://example.net/namespace.txt")
  
  
  What you have just setup is called, in the formal language,
  a "Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface Server"

  The formal interface description for the query server is kept at:

    $ONEBIGSOUP/website/txt/lnxrqueryi.txt

  It can also be found on the Local Names website:

    http://ln.taoriver.net/


  Let's review what you did:
  * You installed "lncore."
  * You installed a query server.
  * You looked at it on the web.
  * You looked at it from Python.


	     == ADDENDUM A:  Make Your Own Namespace! ==

  Whoah! You don't have a namespace yet?

  This is super-easy, super-simple.

  1. Make a new text file, called "my_namespace.txt".

    emacs my_namespace.txt

  2. Copy the following into it:

-------------------------- my_namespace.txt ---/ cut here /-------------
X "VERSION" "1.2"

X "AUTHOR" "John Doe"
X "PREFERRED-NAME" "John Doe's Own Namespace"

LN "My Blog" "http://your.blog.here.net/"

LN "Slashdot" "http://slashdot.org/"
LN "Kuro5hin" "http://kuro5hin.org/"
LN "FreshMeat" "http://freshmeat.net/"

NS "Local Names" "http://ln.taoriver.net/localnames.txt"
-----------------------------------------------/ cut here /-------------

  3. Replace "John Doe" with your name.

    M-x replace-string(ret) John Doe(ret) Your Name(ret)

  4. Add some more links.

    C-n C-n C-n C-n C-n
    LN "new name" "http://example.net"(ret)
    C-x C-s
    C-x C-c


		       --- interlude begins ---

      "Wait, what's up with that last one?"
      "Why does it say "NS," not "LN?"

            - That's something **really cool,**
              ...but it's secret, right now.
              Figure it out, later.

            - Just use "LN" for the links you want to add,
              for now.

			--- interlude end ---


  5. Put my_localnames.txt on the web.

    mv my_localnames.txt "$MY_WEB_SERVING_DIR"

  6. Make sure you can see it in your web browser.

    lynx http://localhost/my_localnames.txt


				NOTE:

      In this example, I used "localhost," but in reality, you
      **almost certainly** want to put your Local Names on the
      web.

      A lot of the **really cool** things in Local Names (like
      letting others connect to your Local Names namespace, using
      your names on other people's sites, using other people's
      nameservers) require that your namespace description is
      publicly visible.


  7. Write down the URL!

    The URL of your namespace, (in the example,
    "http://localhost/my_localnames.txt",) is called your "Namespace
    Description URL."


  When you go back to the main tutorial, try looking up the following!

  checkbox;                           why I'm asking you
  check after     local name           to look this one
  you did it                                  up

     [ ]          "Slashdot"         . make sure it works
     [ ]          "SlaSHdOt"         . how does it handle case?
     [ ]          "  Slashdot  "     . how does it handle white space?
     [ ]          "Kuro5hin"         . another name

     [ ]          "My Blog"          . a name YOU chose!

     [ ]          "NS record"        . wha- ... what the- ...
                                       why does THIS work?!


  That last one is something of a mystery, is it not?

  Can you figure it out?

    HINT:  Look at "http://ln.taoriver.net/localnames.txt"
           in your web browser.

  If you want to experiment with another NS record, feel free to link to
  my **own** personal namespace:

------------------------ add this line to my_namespace.txt -------------
NS "Lion" "http://taoriver.net:9000/description?namespace=lion"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Then, try looking up the following words, through YOUR namespace:

  [ ]  "Joomla"
  [ ]  "OpenOffice"
  [ ]  "Tachikoma"
