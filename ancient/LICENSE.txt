Most of our code is PUBLIC DOMAIN.

Some code follows from other licenses. We would like
to replace that code with PUBLIC DOMAIN code.
However, this is not always possible.

We are in the process of placing proper notes atop
all files. Here is the boilerplate text we'll be
placing at the top of our original code:

"""
  This version of this file has been contributed to by
  the following people.

    LION KIMBRO  -- King County, WA, USA, 2004

  Each and every contributor has placed his or her own
  name above. Each and every contributor, doing so,
  places their contributors into the Public Domain.
  That is, they release any copyrights that had,
  they release any rights to their contributions,
  they allow anyone and everyone to do whatever they
  like with their contributions, etc., etc., etc.,.
  They certify that their contributions were original
  to themselves.

  If you make changes to this file, you need to
  either add your name to this public domain
  declaration, or remove the declaration.
  However, you can keep the list of contributors,
  with a note saying "these are people who
  contributed to this file, and released their
  contributions to the public domain" (or something
  basically like that), so that people can later
  verify that they did in fact contribute what they
  said they contributed.
"""

I would personally like to add the following text
to the public domain dedication, which anyone
can remove if they like:

"""
  LION KIMBRO notes: "I don't like proprietary
  licenses. I request, but do not require, that this
  not be used in properietary software. In particular,
  I request, but do not require, that Microsoft not
  use this software in their own.
"""

Of course, it's not required.
