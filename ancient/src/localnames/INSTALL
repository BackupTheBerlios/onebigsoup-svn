               Welcome to Local Names!



  A brief description of how this is laid out-

  First we talk about general requirements-
  Python 2.3, Cheetah Templates, PHP, WordPress.

  Then how to install the core. And then how to install
  the various services, and some notes on how to install
  MooKitty's blog plug-in.



  REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

  For BASIC LocalNames, you must have:

  * Python2.3


  To run the additional servers, (web browser redirection,
  my.localnames, wiki wrapping,) you must ALSO install:

  * Cheetah Templates    (more on this in a moment)


  To use MooKitty's *SUPER-COOL* blogging support for
  LocalNames, you need:

  * PHP            (version #?)
  * WordPress 1.2  (the blogging system)


  CHEETAH TEMPLATES
============================================================

  Installing Cheetah Templates is basic.
  It works like this:

  * Download    (I use v.0.9.15 -- Lion, Sep 2004)

     http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/download.html

  * untar

     $ tar xvzf Cheetah-0.9.15.tar.gz

  * install

     # python setup.py install

  For more information:

    http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/


  CORE Installation
------------------------------------------------------------

  The MOST IMPORTANT install is the CORE code.


  Enter the "core" directory.

  Edit xmlrpc_server.py.

  * change HOST_NAME to your host name, or "localhost"

  * change PORT_NUMBER to the port number you want to
    run the XML-RPC server from

  * change PASSWORD to something screwy - you probably
    wont' be using this, unless you also run DingDing

  * ULI_ALLOW_DUMP = True is useful while testing,
    but could potentially be abused. What it does, is it
    allows you to dump the cache for a particular
    namespace description. If someone hated you, they
    could force your computer to continuously dump cache.
    So you know.

  After that, you should be able to just run
  the server in the background, and everything
  work fine.

    $ python xmlrpc_server.py &


  To test that it's working, just hit

    http://your-domain:chosen-port/

  ...and you should see the function documentation
  for the XML-RPC server.


  Sorry about the inconsistent names of functions,
  it's been patched and repatched so many times.
  We'll fix it.


  To actually take the resolver for a spin,...

 ----------------------------------------
  $ python
  Python 2.3.3 (#1, May  7 2004, 10:31:40) 
  [GCC 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

  >>> import xmlrpclib

  >>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy( "http://your-domain:chosen-port" )

  [  for example:                                                    ]
  [  s=xmlrpclib.ServerProxy( "http://services.taoriver.net:9089" )  ]

  >>> s.lookup( "http://my.localnames.taoriver.net/spaces/lion/description",
                ["OneBigSoup", "LocalNames"], 1 )
  'http://onebigsoup.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/LocalNames'

  Ho ho!

  You're resolving Local Names!


  Okay, this is all that you need to REALLY use LocalNames.
  This is enough to program to it, and resolve names locally,
  and stuff like that.

  But there's a bunch of fun stuff that, if you install Cheetah,
  you can play use as well.


  Sadly, it's very late, and I'm going to sleep now.

  But some hints before I go:

  * The servers are CGI. Use them with Apache.

  * You MAY need to copy the "localnames.py" and "lnparser.py"
    files to the place where you install the CGI.

  * The servers require Cheetah Templates be installed.
    It's easy to install- I've never had problems installing them.
    Instructions near the top of this document.

  * The servers probably point to an existing XML-RPC install.
    This is referring to the CORE LocalNames server- the one
    I just told you how to install. (It's really really important.
    Install it, and test that it works.) You'll need to edit
    the tops of the files to tell it where the core XML-RPC
    server is installed.

  When we have Rendezvous, it'll all just magically auto-discover,
  I am sure. But for now, you have to actually say where you
  put the LocalNames server, on which host, on which port.

  Theoretically, you can just say "localhost." But, I've had
  problems doing that- for some reason Apache didn't like it.
  For some reason, Apache required that I say
  "services.taoriver.net" on my computer. YMMV.


  Feel free to call me on the cell phone for help.
