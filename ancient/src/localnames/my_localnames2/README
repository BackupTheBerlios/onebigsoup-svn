TO INSTALL:

  1) create directory

     Create a directory to serve from, somewhere.
     Maybe:  mkdir /var/www/localnames

  2) adjust httpd.conf

     * enable .htaccess in the directory you're
       going to be serving from


     Maybe:  Alias /localnames/ "/var/www/localnames/"
             <Directory "/var/www/testing">
               AllowOverride All
             </Directory>

  3) edit conf.sh

     Basically, just telling system where various
     things are found.

     In particular, you give the location of the
     directory you prepared in step 1.

  2) run "sh_install.sh"

     It's a bash script, and it installs the program.


OTHER NOTES:

 * don't know if data.p and data/ dirs will be problems-
   may have to change ownership to apache.apache

 * talk to me, Mother Goose! just let me know what
   you're having problems with
