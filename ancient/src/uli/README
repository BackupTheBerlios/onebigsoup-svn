Getting started:

  Type the following on the command line:

    python ulitool.py http://localnames.taoriver.net/uli/ "help"
    python ulitool.py http://localnames.taoriver.net/uli/ "keys"
    python ulitool.py http://localnames.taoriver.net/uli/ "look lion this"

    alias "ln" "python ulitool.py http://localnames.taoriver.net/uli/"

    ln "keys"
    ln "look lion RoboticEvidence"
    ln "look lion RecentChanges"
    ln "look lion OneBigSoup RecentChanges"

  That should give you the basic idea of what this is all about-
  Command line services, available over the Internet.


Some services to explore:

  (list recorded on: 2004-08-01)

  http://localnames.taoriver.net/uli/
  http://services.taoriver.net:9090/  (use ULI/XML-RPC)
  http://services.taoriver.net:9303/

  Send a line with just "help" to get a list of commands.


What we want:

  We are working to make a bunch of services:
  * data-structure builders
  * one-time pad password generators and authenticators
  * URL information gatherers (like ChumpBot)
  * document editing (like "ed", but smarter, and HTML/wiki-like)

  We also want to expand to...:
  * Jabber Bots
  * CGI scripts that make it so you can do ULI calls (should be basic)
