  |  Local Names v1.1 Core  |
  ===========================


  We use these modules to interpret, store, and resolve Local Names.

      lnparser.py  --  Local Names description parser
      localnames.py  --  Local Names storage, utilities, and resolution


  You should install both of them on your system.


  lnparser
  --------

    * very reusable
    * simple parser
    * easy to figure out

  localnames
  ----------

    * may not be reusable for your project
    * started life as a back-end for the XML-RPC server
    * goal: to generalize a bit more
