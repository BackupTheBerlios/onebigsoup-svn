  |  Local Names v1.1 Resolver Server  |
  ======================================


  This is a Local Names resolver server. Read the server.py module
  docstring for more information.

  REQUIREMENTS:
   * core Local Names libraries (found in /lncore)
   * configure server.py -- variables commented with "# CONFIGURE"

	       /!\  THIS SERVER DOES NOT FOLLOW A   /!\
	      /!\  SPECIFIED QUERY SERVER INTERFACE  /!\

  That is, don't build on top of this server too much! We're going to
  huck it, in exchange for a server that DOES follow a specified query
  server interface- the "Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface."
