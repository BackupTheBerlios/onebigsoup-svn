  Local Names Store Bookmarklets make it so you can store Local Names
  into a server implementing the Local Names XML-RPC Store Interface
  (LNXRStoreI.)


  INSTALLING
  ----------

  Instructions current to: 2005-07-18

  Copy all .py and .html files into a CGI directory.

  Edit variable names that are in ALL CAPS in "shared.py." 

  Do whatever you have to do to get Apache running the CGI,
  and then hit page "input.py" with a web browser to try it out.

  Local Names XML-RPC Store Server not included. The other folders in
  the lnstore directory can help you with that. {:)}=
