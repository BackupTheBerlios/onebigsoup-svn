  Thank you for trying out Local Names!		       /   /
				       	       	      /	\ /
  I think you'll find Local Names to be very		 /.--.
  useful, and indispensible once you've used	       	/ |  |
  it for a while.				       /  '--'

  Let me know what you think, and let me           Chinese Character
  know if you need any help setting it up.           for "Name"

  You can just call me on my cell phone, or
  by the information at the bottom of this
  page, if you're uncomfortable calling me.

  Thank you,

== Installation ==


  SUMMARY:
  1. Copy local_names.php to plugins directory.
  2. Activate plugin.
  3. Configure in Options, Local Names.
     4. Enter LNXRQueryI URL.
     5. Enter Namespace Description URL.
     6. Click "Update Options."
  7. You're done!


1. Copy local_names.php to your $blog/wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Log into your blogs "Site Admin," click on "Plugins," and then
   activate the "Local Names" plugin.
3. Click on "Options" and then "Local Names."
4. Enter your Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface URL.

    If you don't know what to put here, just put either:

      http://ln.taoriver.net/lnxrqs

    ... or, if that doesn't work, ...

      http://taoriver.net:8123/

    These are hosted on Lion Kimbro's computer today, 2006-08-26.

5. Enter your Namespace Description URL.

    Your **namespace** is your **personal** collection of names for
    things on the Internet.  If you call "http://wordpress.org/" simply
    "WordPress," then that goes into your namespace.

    Your namespace is written on a page on the Internet; That page has a
    URL, and that URL is known as your "Namespace Description URL."

    There are two ways to make your namespace description.  One is to
    write it manually, by hand, and put it on the Internet.  It's URL is
    your namespace description URL.

    An easier way is to make a namespace on "My Local Names."

    Visit:

        http://taoriver.net:9000/

    ...and type in your name, and a password if you want one.  It'll
    give you your Namespace Description URL, and a bookmarklet you can
    use to add names to your Namespace Description.

6. Click "Update options."
7. Your installation is now complete.

== How to Use ==


It's really easy!

When you write a post, use [[brackets]] to automatically link names.

Here is an example post:

 [--B-I-ABC--*-123-<->--[-I-]--oo-o><o-&-H--)-(-HTML-?----------------]
 |								      |
 |  Good morning! This is [[Lion Kimbro]] making use of the	      |
 |  [[Local Names Plugin]] to make this post.  It helps me automate   |
 |  [[hyperlink]]ing.  This way, I don't have to look up [[URL]]s     |
 |  for every page I might want to link to.			      |
 |								      |
 |  Something you might not know about [[Local Names]]:		      |
 |								      |
 |  Did you know that you can configure [[FireFox]] to use Local      |
 |  Names to jump to web pages?  If I type "ln Local Names" in my     |
 |  browser address bar, it automatically takes me to		      |
 |  "http://ln.taoriver.net/".  And if I type "ln pancakes", it	      |
 |  automatically takes me to					      |
 |  "http://youtube.com/watch?v=PnCVZozHTG8", the [[Pancakes]] video  |
 |  on [[YouTube]].						      |
 |								      |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN YOU TELL IT to Save, or when you tell it to "Save and Continue
Editing," the Local Names plugin will hyperlink all the bracketed text.

You can also hyperlink without using the name:

 [--B-I-ABC--*-123-<->--[-I-]--oo-o><o-&-H--)-(-HTML-?----------------]
 |							       	      ^
 |  I was talking with [[Joel Ford | my friend]] the other day,	      |
 |  about [[StarCraft | a game we used to play a lot.]]  I told him   |
 |  that [[Sakura | my daughter]] has been playing it a lot lately,   |
 |  and is getting pretty good at the [[Zerg]] missions.	      |
 |								      v
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

Again: hyperlinking happens WHEN YOU HIT "SAVE" OR "SAVE AND CONTINUE
EDITING."


== What if there's a problem? ==


If you can't connect to the Internet, or
if the nameserver is down, you'll get a	         *
message in red, at the top of your post,        _|             __
telling you what is wrong.		       (__  Question?   _)
                                                               |
If you use a name, but it's not defined,                       *
that name will be written in red, rather       	       	       	   jgs
than hyperlinked.

If you define a new name, but the cache hasn't expired, go to the
cache-dumping website:

  http://ln.taoriver.net/dumpcache

If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to e-mail or call.


== Enjoy! ==


  I **really** hope you like Local Names, and welcome ALL feedback!

  Just writing a blog post, telling what you think, is really helpful.
  And you can always email me (lion@speakeasy.org,) or even give me a
  phone call, at 206.427.2545.

  I appreciate any and all ideas or advice. Even criticism is
  appreciated.

  So again, one last time:

  Thank you!
