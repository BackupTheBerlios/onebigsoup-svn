# How to run:

#
# How to include:
#
#    . ./conftests.sh
#
#
# this:
#   * performs basic configuration sanity checks
#   * relies on "conf.sh"
#
#
# optional environment variables:
#   * MY_LOCALNAMES_CONF_FILE,
#       - default: "./conf.sh"
#       - can set to say where to find configuration file
#     ex:
#       export MY_LOCALNAMES_CONF_FILE="/home/lion/my.localnames.conf.sh"
#
#
# SEE ALSO:
#   * install.sh
#   * uninstall.sh
