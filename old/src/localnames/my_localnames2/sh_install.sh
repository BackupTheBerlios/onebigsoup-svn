# install.sh
#
# (c) 2004 Lion Kimbro - released into public domain
#
#
# How to run:
#
#    $ ./install.sh
#
#
# This:
#   * is a tool managing my.localnames installation
#   * relies on "conf.sh"
#   * performs basic sanity checks
#   * installs "index.cgi", ".htaccess"
#   * installs Python scripts
#
# This DOES NOT:
#   * create & permission the TARGET directory
#   * alter httpd.conf
#
#   ...you must do those things yourself.
#
#
# APACHE:
#
#   This does NOT configure Apache (httpd.conf) for you!
#
#   We supply a .htaccess file, but you'll need to
#   enable "AllowOverride All" yourself, for the target
#   installation directory..!
#
#   Your httpd.conf entry MAY look something like:
#
#   Alias /mylocalnames/ "/var/www/my.localnames/"
#   <Directory "/var/www/my.localnames/">
#       AllowOverride All
#   </Directory>
#
#
# SEE ALSO:
#   * uninstall.sh

#
#   THIS NEEDS SOME HELP;
#   Specificly, on my testing computer,
#   it seems that accessing the directory
#   itself doesn't work- you have to
#   specifly name index.cgi within the
#   directory.
#
#   I had hoped that "DirectoryIndex" would
#   be enough, but, for some reason,
#   it doesn't seem to be.
#
#   Please help fix this, should you know how.
