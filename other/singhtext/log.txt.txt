The token type regexes need to work on individual lines.

That's why we're getting these \s bugs. \s*'s and \s+'s are eating up
newlines. I can't figure out how to make them stop.

So, I'm going to take the tokenizer, and make it work on newlines. The
trick is the #regions, but I can use state for that.


= 2005-06-07 =

== 9:03 AM ==

I believe I need to make the link regex into a multiline regex.

Yokai! It works!

Now the question is, does [[this]] work for linking?

If that does, then I believe we're all done for the time being here.

In the future, we might want to interface off handling of $special lines
and #region lines.

You could also interface off link resolution. Make a module for doing
Local Names via dictionary, make a module for doing Local Names from an
actual Internet lookup.

''Yes, it does work.'' So, now for rendering the website and what not!

== 7:36 PM ==

So it looks like, with $name, ...

Ah, make sure the HTML is right, and check that that sort of HTML is
actually the HTML we want.

Yes- yes, it does work! Okay, so full speed ahead now, making sure the
HTML is right. And that the test is right.

== 10:46 AM ==

I need to:
* test whether $name makes an <a name='foo'/>
** it's written, just needs testing.
* test whether naming points like that actually works in HTML.

== 10:43 AM ==

Okay, I've got "$name" list-building done. Now for the HTML.

But, after that- then what?

I think it's back to the tools chain then- building web pages and
localnames.txt lists from this stuff.

== 10:11 AM ==

* "$set" is done, here I go on $name.

A thought occurs to me: Does it do ''italic'' and '''bold'''
replacements within list items? We'll have to see.

I now wish that tokens had been in their own class. That way, the "turn
into HTML" functionality could be part of the token. But is this really
the right decision? I suppose it could be tried in a future version, or
something.

Advantages:
* don't have to keep unpacking the tuple list
* don't have to keep unpacking the sub-tuple list
* can attach HTML production intelligence to the token
* class & component infrastructure possibilities
** adapter

Disadvantages:
* harder to communicate external info to token,
* algorithmic intel not all in same place

Then again, there are wilder things to be done, such as using a parser.

Anyways: $name.

It ($name) produces HTML and a list.

== 9:56 AM ==

* Okay, I'm debugging $set. After this is $name.


= 2005-05-31 =

== 9:17 AM ==

Almost done with $set; Just need to debug it now.

I'm sure it's working to the level of tokenization. Now, I need to make
it make a nice variable list out of that. I suspect the code that
performs the regex reading and dictionary filling.

So, fix that, Lion.

== ~8:30 AM ==

Working on the title ($set title: foo) and the sections.

Plan:

# $set
# $name


= 2005-05-30 =

I'm putting in:
* the ability to title a page
* the abliity to name sections (A NAME)

The A NAME has special rendering considerations, so I'm going to give it
one "$special" signifier.

But the other, we can make more general metadata. "$set title:
foo". You'll set ''any'' value with $set.
