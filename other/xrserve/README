  ====================


  This Python module is a gateway between XML-RPC requests, and Python
  modules.

  Basically: Put this script in a directory with Python modules, and run
  it. Any Python modules in the same directory that define
  XMLRPC_namespace will be immediately callable by XML-RPC.
