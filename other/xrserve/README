  |  XML-RPC SERVER  |
  ====================


  This Python module is a gateway between XML-RPC requests, and Python
  modules.

  Basically: Just put this script in a directory with Python modules,
  rand run it. Any Python modules in the same directoy that define
  XMLRPC_namespace will be immediately callable by XML-RPC.
