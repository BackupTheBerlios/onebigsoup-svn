  ===============


  MonoStore is a Local Names Store Server. It implements the Local Names
  XML-RPC Store Interface (LNXRStoreI).

  The server is simple, and does not make full use of the
  LNXRStoreI. Specificly, it:

  * supports only a single namespace (you cannot create and delete
    namespaces)
  * does not support passwords- anybody can come by, and unset
    everything out of your namespace description

  There is a flaw in the implementation:
  * only supports a single extension value per extension key (that is,
    X records can only have one value per key)


  INSTALLING
  ----------

  Instructions current to: 2005-11-05

  The top of the script describes the details of installation and
  configuration, but here's an intuitive explanation:

    1. Create a directory. (Or perhaps reuse a CGI directory.)
    2. Copy monostore.py to it.
    3. Copy xrcgi.py to it. (found in /other/xrcgi)
    4. Set variables in monostore.py:
       * NAMESPACE_DESCRIPTION_PATH
            -- where the namespace description will be stored
       * NAMESPACE_DESCRIPTION_URL
            -- how the public will get to the namespace description
       * NAMESPACE_DATA_PATH
            -- where the data for the namespace will be stored
       * (maybe put the data and the namespace description in the same
          directory as the scripts)
    5. Make sure file permissions are good.
       * That is, make sure that the Apache user can run the script,
         and whenever the script creates or edits something, that
         it'll work.
    6. Configure Apache.
       * Make sure the Apache user can run the script.
         (Make sure that the script is interpreted as a CGI.)
       * Make sure that the public can read the namespace description.
    7. Make sure the script runs.
       * Point a web browser at xrcgi.py. You should see the interface
         documentation.
       * If it's not working, you need to figure out why Apache isn't
         running the script.
    7. Call "set" once.
       * Start a Python shell.
       * import xmlrpclib
       * s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://example.com/.../xrcgi.py")
       * s.set("password", "default",
               "LN", "slashdot", "http://slashdot.org/")
       * This will trigger the creation of the namespace description.
    8. Make sure the namespace description exists.
       * Point a web browser at the NAMESPACE_DESCRIPTION_URL.
       * If you don't see a namespace description, you need to figure
         out why the script isn't able to create the namespace
         description. It's probably a filesystem permissions problem;
         make sure the user the web server is running as ("apache"..?)
         has write access to the NAMESPACE_DESCRIPTION_PATH.
 
  You're done!
