== 2006-06-21: v1.2 Implemented ==

I, [[Lion Kimbro] Lion Kimbro,] finished the v1.2 implemetation. I
checked the specs, tested the implementation, worked out some bugs,
and fixed up the website.

[[Local Names]] is now at the point where I am comfortable using it
daily, and helping people set it up on their computers.

I've revisted Local Names ''now,'' because I'm about to switch primary
tasks in a major way; I hope to post something to [[my blog]] explaining
more about where I am going, soon. But I don't believe I'll be back on
Local Names as my main activity for a long time.

There are some last minute logistics I haven't integrated into the
website documentation. I list them here:

* The Local Names XML-RPC Query Server is at:
  [[http://ln.taoriver.net/lnxrqs]]
** I encourage you to play with it.
* There is a website for dumping it's cache:
  [[http://ln.taoriver.net/dumpcache]]
** So, if you make a [[namespace description] namespace description,]
   and then make some changes to it, and wonder why links aren't
   working-- it's because the cache hasn't been dumped yet. Use this
   webpage to dump the cache.
* There is an undocumented feature: [[PATTERN]] supports not just
  "$NAME", but also "$ARG1", "$ARG2", "$ARG3", ... and so
  on. ("$ARGn").
** It's just a matter of adding the explanation on how to use them to
   the relevant specifications.
** I'll add them to the 1.4 specifications. In the meantime, feel free
   to rely on them, if you can gather how it works from the source code.
* There is a ''bug''': [[X FINAL]] [[relative URL]relative URLs] do not
  work.
** I know how to fix it. It's just a matter of doing it.
** If someone wants this and asks me for it, I will fix it.

== 2005-06-21: Site Reworking, Interface Specification ==

The project has undergone a lot of changes! We are now much more focused
on [[Local Names interface] interfaces] and [[specs] specifications.]

We have specified the [[LNXRStoreI] Local Names XML-RPC Store
Interface,] and we are in the process of specifying the [[LNXRQueryI]
Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface;] The only thing we need, really, is
to figure out how we're going to report errors. So, it's almost done!

We're almost to the fun part: Writing code.

== 2004-12-12: Static Site Up ==

Okay! I'm working on setting up the Local Names static site.

It's not completely up yet; I'll create another newsmessage when it is.

This page is only for major changes and what not. For more
minute-by-minute details about what's going on, you'll have to
[[http://lion.taoriver.net/] follow my blog.]
