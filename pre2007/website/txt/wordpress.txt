The Local Names WordPress Plugin automatically links [[local names]]
to [[URL]]s in WordPress posts.

Use [[7-zip]] to untar it on Windows, "tar xvzf lnwordpress.tgz" to untar it on Linux.


== How To Use It ==

There's actually a ''very'' nice tutorial in the README, but this diagram can serve as a preview:

In short,

#CODE
[[your name here]]
#CODE

...or...

#CODE
[[your name here | your link text here]]
#CODE

...the plugin changes the text to remove the brackets, and hyperlink
the text.


== Getting A Namespace ==

A [[namespace]] is ''your'' personal collection of names that link to URLs.

You can make a namespace from scratch on your own, or you can use [[My Local Names]] to make and maintain your namespace.

== Isn't there already a plugin that does automatic linking? ==

There are many great plugins that already do automatic linking.

If you use one, consider telling the authors about [[Local Names
Website] Local Names.]  If the author adds support for producing
[[namespace descriptions,]] then you can use the names you define
there in any other contexts that support Local Names!

What is ''unique'' to Local Names, is that it's based on the idea of
publishing name-URL binding lists, so that you can reuse them in
different contexts.

You should be able to use your names in...

* your wiki,
* your web browser, (to tell it to go to places by name alone,)
* your mail client,
* your instant messenger,
* in IRC,
* in your web page editor,
* ...and so on, and so forth.

Any place where you can produced hyperlinks, you should be able to use
Local Names.  My goal is to make Local Names work in as many places as
I can write plug-ins for.

Please read [[About Local Names]] for more information, and a
technical introduction.
