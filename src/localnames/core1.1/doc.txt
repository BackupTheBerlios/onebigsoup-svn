## PANIC BUTTON ##

**CALL LION AT 206.427.2545 IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF TROUBLE.**

If it's the year 2006 or greater, don't bother. e-mail instead. But
2005? Definitely call me.

**CALL LION AT 206.427.2545 IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF TROUBLE.**

Believe me: It's no bother. What's **far more** bothersome to me is
the idea that someone, somewhere, is having trouble getting their
Local Names server started.

**CALL LION AT 206.427.2545 IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF TROUBLE.**

To make this a little more attractive, I promise a free card,
AT LEAST, and perhaps roses (for females) or a free video game
(for males) should you call me, and I help you set up your Local Names
server.

**CALL LION AT 206.427.2545 IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF TROUBLE.**

Call me. I mean it.

**CALL LION AT 206.427.2545 IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF TROUBLE.**

Dude, this is the 2000's.

## Installation ##

You need:
* python2.3
* server.py --  HTTP & XML-RPC interface to the world
* localnames.py --  internal logic
* lnparser.py --  parsing

At the bottom of server.py, change "localhost" to the host name you'll
be running under, and change "9001" to the port number you'll be
running under.

Then, just type "python2.3 server.py", and it should be running!

Test it by hitting it with a web server. You should get a brief note
telling you that a Local Names server is running.

Try resolving some lookups. Don't worry, if it takes a few moments for
it to start loading in it's first namespaces, that's perfectly normal.

## Interfaces ##

The server supports two interfaces:

* [[HTTP]] ([[GET]] & [[POST]])
* [[XML-RPC]]

### HTTP Interface Documentation ###

Each [[HTTP]] interface is documented something like so

      ?action=foo
    [ &namespace=(url) ]+
      &lookup=(lookup term)
      &separator=(character)

This means that if the server was served at "http://foo.bar", then the
following URL would meet this interface:

    http://foo.bar/?action=foo&namespace=http://bar.baz/
                   &lookup=overthere|robots are neat
                   &separator=|

Key:

    [   ...   ]    optional, one allowed
    [   ...   ]*   optional, many allowed
    [   ...   ]+   1 required, many allowed
       (foo)       variable, put your data here


### XML-RPC Interface Documentation ###

The same thing might be documented as follows, for the [[XML-RPC]]
interface:

    foo( "url" or ["url", ...],
         "lookup string",
         "separator" )

"foo" here is the name of the XML-RPC method.

The first argument can either be a string url ("url"), or it can be a
list of string urls (["url", ...]).

The second argument is a string, and the third argument is a string.

Do try and follow along.

If you have questions, e-mail [[Lion]] (lion at speakeasy.org),
or call him on his cell phone (206.427.2545).

(Feel free to call me on my cell phone, if the year is 2005.
 I don't care what time it is, just call me, dammit!)


## API ##

### Browser Redirection ###

Redirect the web browser with a 301 Location response.

GET:

      ?action=redirect
      &namespace=http://...
      &lookup=(lookup term)
    [ &separator=(character) ]

XML-RPC:

      (none)

The separator tells how to cut the lookup into [[NS]] or [[PATTERN]]
lookups, and the final [[LN]] lookup.

Lookups for redirection are performed with the "loose" and
"check-neighboring-spaces" flags set. (See Local Names Lookup
description for more on lookup flags.)


examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
        ?action=redirect
        &namespace=http://taoriver.net/data/namespaces/theprophet/
        &lookup=reason

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
        ?action=redirect
        &namespace=http://ln.taoriver.net/localnames.txt
        &lookup=S/WP/Kahlil_Gibran
        &separator=/


### Local Names Lookup ###

Lookup the URL that 1 or more local names are bound to.

GET:

      ?action=lookup
      &namespace=http://...
    [ &lookup=(lookup term) ]+
    [ &seperator=(character) ]

XML-RPC:

    lookup( "name" or ["path", "to", "name"]
            or [ ["path", "to", "name"],... ],
            "url",
            ["list", "of", "flags"] )


Note: There's a hole in the [[HTTP]] API; You can only specify lookup
flags in the [[XML-RPC]] interface, so far.

The GET interface returns one line per lookup.

The XML-RPC interface returns either a string or a list, to match
whether you requested a single, or multiple, names.

Upon failure, the XML-RPC interface will return a 4-tuple:

* (list) successfully resolved URLS & NS names
* (string) "NS", "LN", or "LOAD" - indicating the failure point
* (string) name of failed [[NS]NS lookup] or [[LN]LN lookup failure], or [[hop]URL of failed LOAD]
* (string) human readable error string

The HTTP interface only gives you the human readable error string.

Flags:

* "loose": ignore case, punctuation, and white space
* "check-neighboring-spaces": if the LN is not found in the last NS, check all neighboring namespaces as well.
* "reverse": reverse lookup (URL, not name, at end of path)
* "NS": namespace-lookup; (NS, not LN, at end of path)
* "suppress-final": don't use "X [[FINAL]]"


examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
      ?action=lookup
      &namespace=http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt
      &lookup=robotic nation
      &lookup=Marshall Brain
      &lookup=S/WP/robot
      &lookup=vinge
      &separator=/

    lookup( [ ["robotic nation"],
              ["Marshall Brain"],
              ["S", "WP", "robot"] ],
            "http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt",
            ["loose", "check-neighboring-spaces"] )


### Rendering & Aggregation ###

Render a namespace in a different form, and/or aggregate namespaces
together.


GET:

      ?action=render
    [ &namespace=(url) ]+
    [ &format=(format) ]

XML-RPC:

    render( "format",
            "url" or ["url", ...] )

If you list multiple namespaces, that means "aggregate these
namespaces." They are returned in the chosen format.

Formats:

* "version1.1" --  cleaned up [[spec1.1]Local Names v1.1] text
* "original" --  as cached, by the server
* "XML-RPC" --  as a dictionary with keys LN, NS, X, and PATTERN.
* "XML-RPC-text" --  the raw text of such an XML-RPC response
* "python" --  extremely useful for understanding the server'sthoughts

In the HTTP interface, "XML-RPC" is the same as "XML-RPC-text".


examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
        ?action=render
        &format=version1.1
        &namespace=http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt

    render( "version1.1",
            "http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt" )


    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
        ?action=render
        &format=version1.1
        &namespace=http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt
        &namespace=http://www.ludism.org/~rwhe/localnames.txt
        &namespace=http://greg.vario.us/ln/description

    render( "XML-RPC",
            [ "http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt",
              "http://www.ludism.org/~rwhe/localnames.txt",
              "http://greg.vario.us/ln/description" ] )


### Cache Records ###

What's cached? What people been looking at? Let's see!

GET:

      ?action=cached

XML-RPC:

      cached()


GET returns a neat visual 3-column layout. The first column is the
URL, the second column is the friendly X PREFERRED-NAME for the
namespace, and the third column is the number of seconds until the
cache entry runs out.

The XML-RPC interface returns a list of lists. The sublists feature
the same information, just in a nice pre-parsed form.

It's near impossible to parse the GET version; if you really need the
info, use the XML-RPC form.

examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/?action=cached

    cached()


### Dump the Cache ###

Dump a namespace cache. Call this when you change your namespace, and
want to try it out.

GET:

      ?action=dump-cache
    [ &namespace=(url) ]+

XML-RPC:

      dump_cache( "url" )

For some strange reason, you can only dump one cache entry at a time
by the XML-RPC API. Oh well! Gotta ship this thing *some* time.

examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
      ?action=dump-cache
      &namespace=http://foo.bar/baz.txt
      &namespace=http://foo.bar/boz.txt

    dump_cache( "http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt" )


### Validate ###

Return a list of errors in a [[namespace description]].

GET:

      ?action=validate
      &namespace=(url)

XML-RPC:

      validate( "url" )

GET returns either "No Errors. OK!" on one line, or the errors, one
per line. Each line is prefixed with the line number the error was
found on.

XML-RPC is similar: a list of errors, each error represented by a
2-tuple: (line#, "error message.")


examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
        ?action=validate
        &namespace=http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt

    validate( "http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt" )


### Index Of Names ###

Return a list of JUST the names, or JUST the namespaces,...

GET:

      ?action=index
    [ &namespace=(url) ]+
    [ &record-type=(LN,NS,X, or PATTERN) ]

XML-RPC:

      index( "url" or [ "url", ... ],
             record_type )

In the GET interface, if you don't specify a record-type, it's assumed
to be "LN." In the XML-RPC interface, you MUST specify a record-type.

In both interfaces, you can specify multiple namespaces. They will be
considered in order.

The XML-RPC interface returns a list of matching keys; The GET
interface returns them one per line.

examples:

    http://services.taoriver.net:9090/
        ?action=index
        &namespace=http://ln.taoriver.net/servicenames.txt
        &record-type=PATTERN

    index( "http://ln.taoriver.net/servicenames.txt", "PATTERN" )


### Filter Text ###

Text filtering is very useful, but somewhat complicated.

#### HTTP POST: HttpPipe ####

There is no [[GET]] interface. Instead, there is a [[POST]] interface.
In particular, it is the "HttpPipe" interface, recently minted.

POST to the URL of the server. Form encode your data, in standard
application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. UTF-8 charset your
characters. You must define two FORM keys: "namespace", and "body".
The text to be filtered goes in "body", the namespace to use goes in
"namespace".

The following website is sufficient in most web browsers:

    <html><head><title>HttpPipe</title></head>
    <body>
    <form action="http://services.taoriver.net:9090/" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8">
      <p><textarea name="body" rows="5" cols="80">[ [ Local Names ] ] are fun!</textarea></p>
      <p>Namespace: <input type="text" name="namespace" size="30" value="http://taoriver.net/tmp/gmail.txt" /></p>
      <p><input type="submit"/></p>
    </form>
    </body>
    </html>

Most languages allow you to do the same thing.

#### XML-RPC: XmlRpcFilteringPipe ####

The XML-RPC interface instead uses the [[XmlRpcFilteringPipe]]
interface.

See [[XmlRpcFilteringPipe]the documentation] on [[Les Orchard]Les Orchards] site for more information.

#### Text Format ####

WARNING! We're adding extra spaces around the "[" and "]" characters,
because we don't yet have escaping, and we're using the tool itself
to render this documentation.

So, in all these examples and instructions, imagine NO white space
around the brackets and parenthesis!

Links and images are denoted by [ [ foo ] ].

Links are A HREF'ed, images are IMG SRC'ed.

Examples:
     [ [ some name ] ]
     [ [ NS link ][ NS link ][ LN name ] ]
     [ [ some name ] some other text covering it ]
     [ [ NS link ][ LN name ] some other text ]
     [ [ :) ] ]

Softlinks have the form:

      ( ( foo ) ( bar ) )

...which becomes a link to:

      (SOFTLINK_BASE)?action=redirect&url=(URL)&lookup=foo&lookup=bar

Images (.png, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg) are made into
&lt;IMG SRC="http://..."/&gt;, unless there is cover text,
in which case it's linked text.  Only applies to
hard lookups.
