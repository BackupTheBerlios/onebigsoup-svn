Need:
* pages in format
* html template
* build script:


       	       	       	        HTML Template
			    	     |
       	   Pages     (WikiSyntax)    V		      Linking can only
	    in 	  ------->*--------> * (Cheetah)      occur proper after
	   Format      	   \   	     |		      a master names
       	       	       	   |         |		      table has included
			 Names 	     V		      everything.

	  Names Table (2)-----'  Final HTML
			            pages

  1. Start with the base names table.
  2. Go through every document, and strip names from it.
      --> Title
      --> A NAMEs
      --> Glossary Entries
  3. Then, you can perform linking for your documents.



 . o O (We could prefix Local Names with a special sequence,
        to ease identification,...)


Plan of attack?
* Collect existing content onto Sakura's computer.
* Choose a wiki-like syntax. (AsciiDoc?!?)
** Require: Ability to export key-value pairs.
** Require: Ability to output fragments.
** Require: Ability to put Local Names as link output.
* Convert content to wiki-like syntax.
* Build an HTML Template.
* Make wiki-like syntax export names list.
* Make a build script.
* Try it out!
* YAY! We have an easy-to-build site!
