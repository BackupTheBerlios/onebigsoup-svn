$name What is Local Names?
== What is Local Names? ==

Local Names is a way to bind ''names'' to [[URL] URLs.]

It's so you can talk about things ''naturally.'' Not just talk about
them, but ''link'' to them, too. But ''not'' having to break your
concentration, looking up URLs.

Local Names was inspired by [[wiki]]. In a wiki, you don't have to break
your concentration, to make a link. You just type something out, and it
links. It's incredibly userful, and lends itself towards [[HyperText]
hyper-text] and [[LinkLanguage] link language.] It becomes much easier
to understand what people are talking about, and it becomes easier to
refer back to important pages or conversations.

Local Names can be used in wiki, [[blog] blogs,] bulletin boards,
instant messengers, [[IRC] IRC,] [[Jabber] Jabber,] mail
programs. Articles, responses, posts- they can all, potentially, make
use of Local Names.

Local Names can form links ''from'' anywhere text can be written, ''to''
anything identifiable by URL. That means you could point a name to an
image.

Even things like media players, (which can play files located at URLs,)
or [[RDF]] descriptions, could be trained to work with Local Names.

Presently, it is possible (though difficult) to use Local Names with
[[Firefox]], and many wiki by [[WikiFeatures:InterLink]InterLink.] (You
can follow [[OBS:TheRadar]our implementation plan,] which casts into
2006.)


$name The Basics
== The Basics ==

You start with the idea of a [[namespace] namespace.] The namespace is a
place where you keep [[local name] local names.] Inside a namespace,
names are bound to URLs.

#LITERAL
<img style="float: right;" class="explaining"
 src="ns_is_textfile.png" />
#LITERAL

So, for example, you have a personal namespace of your own. And in your
namespace, you have the names of your friends, and links to their web
pages.

Now, namespaces are described in text files called [[namespace
description] "namespace descriptions."] These files are best viewed as a
collection of [[line] lines,] with three [[column] columns] each.

The first column is special, and it's called the [[record type] record
type.] The data in the second and third columns- whatever they mean, it
depends on the record type.

The most common record type is [[LN] LN.] LN stands for [[local name]
local name.] That is, it means, "We're going to link the name in the
second column to the URL in the third column."

So, here's where part of my namespace description looks like. Just this
fragment, it's a perfectly valid namespace description.

#CODE
X VERSION 1.2
LN "my website" "http://www.speakeasy.org/~lion/"
LN "my blog" "http://lion.taoriver.net/"
LN "Bootstrap Institute" "http://www.bootstrap.org/"
LN "cyborg" "http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_01_28_archive.asp"
LN "greg" "http://greg.vario.us"
LN "joel" "http://www.livejournal.com/users/bug_complex/"
LN "bpt" "http://www.livejournal.com/users/bpt/"
LN "kpreid" "http://homepage.mac.com/kpreid/"
#CODE

And so on, and so forth.

Here, practice yourself. Make a Local Names namespace description,
righter here, just to get the form through your eyes, brain, and hand:

#LITERAL
<form><textarea rows="3" cols="80"></textarea></form>
#LITERAL


$name Linking Namespaces
== Linking Namespaces ==

It's very useful to link namespaces to namespaces.

We discovered this in [[wiki] wiki,] when we invented
[[WikiFeatures:InterLink] the InterLink.] That is, in many
[[WikiFeatures:WikiEngine] wiki engines,] you can link to pages in other
wiki. You do with with a format something like:

#CODE
WikiFeatures:RecentChanges
#CODE

...which links to [[WikiFeatures:RecentChanges]
WikiFeatures:RecentChanges.]

It's very convenient, and you come to expect it.

So, the concept exists in [[Local Names]] as well. You can make what's
called an [[NS]] [[record] record,] and link a namespace to a
neighboring namespace.

#LITERAL

<img class="indented" src="ns_linking.png" />
</center>
#LITERAL

Here's what a namespace description looks like, using this concept:

#CODE
X VERSION 1.1
LN "my website" "http://www.speakeasy.org/~lion/"
LN "my blog" "http://lion.taoriver.net/"
LN "Bootstrap Institute" "http://www.bootstrap.org/"
LN "cyborg" "http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_01_28_archive.asp"

NS "python" "http://www.python.org/moin/LibraryReferencesNames?action=raw"
NS "java" "http://greg.vario.us/names/Java%20Libraries.names"
#CODE

Those last two lines are NS records, and they mean that this namespace
is linked to the namespace described at those URLs.

So, for example, the namespace is linked to a namespace named "Python."
The Python namespace is described by the namespace description at URL
[[http://www.python.org/moin/LibraryReferenceNames?action=raw]].

Note that the Python namespace isn't ''universally'' labelled "Python."
In some other namespace, for example, it might be called "Library
Reference," or something like that. Namespaces can suggest names for
themselves, via an [[X]] record, but they don't have to be respected.


$name Other Records
== Other Records ==

There are ''four'' types of records:

* [[LN]] -- defining [[local name] local names]
* [[NS]] -- linking to other [[namespace] namespaces]
* [[PATTERN]]  -- defining ''pattern substitutions''
* [[X]] -- setting ''extension data''

Refer to the [[spec]] for more detailed information, but we'll talk
briefly here about the X records.

X records are for metadata. So for example:

#CODE
X "PREFERRED-NAME" "lion"
#CODE

...means that the preferred NS name for the namespace is "lion."

Another X key is "FINAL." The FINAL key tells what URL pattern to use to
link a local name to, if there are no LN records for that name.

An example:

#CODE
X FINAL http://example.net/$NAME/
#CODE

So, this concludes the introduction to the Local Names namespace
description.

Next, how the namespace descriptions are used by applications.


$name How Local Names are Used
== How Local Names are Used ==

An application talks with a [[Local Names Query Server] Local Names
Query Server (LNQS).]

The application asks the query server to resolve names, and it gets back
the URLs.

#LITERAL
<img class="indented" align="right" src="ns_hopping.png" />
#LITERAL

So we see here, we have an application. It could be a wiki, it could be
a blog, it could be a bulletin board, instant messenger, mail
program. It could be an article, a response, a post, whatever.

The application asks for help from the query server. The query server
answers from it's cache, or goes out looking around for more namespace
descriptions on the web. The query server then responds to the
application with what it's found.

This is basically just like [[DNS] DNS.] No big surprises here.


$name Basics, Concluded
== Basics, Concluded ==

So you have:

* [[namespace] Namespaces,] one text file per [[namespace] namespace.]
* The text file is called a [[namespace description] namespace
  description.]
* The namespace description is a bunch of [[record] records.]
* There are [[LN]] records, that link [[local name] local names] to
  [[URL] URLs.]
* There are [[NS]] records, that link namespaces to other namespaces.
* There are [[X]] records, that provide additional information.
* Applications talk to a [[query server] query server,] which looks
  through namespaces to resolve names.
