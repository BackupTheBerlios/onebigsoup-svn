  LOCAL NAMES XML-RPC QUERY INTERFACE
  ===================================

  This is the specification for the Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface
  (LNXRQueryI).


  BACKGROUND
  ==========

  Local Names [1] is a system for binding local names to global URLs. The
  initial motivation was to help communities form link language. But it's
  useful for other things as well, such as discovering and resolving short
  names for software components that are arranged in a graph.

  [2] http://communitywiki.org/LinkLanguage


  PURPOSE
  =======

  The purpose is to make a standard way to resolve Local Names, given a
  Local Names query server. People will probably want to write their own
  names servers, optimized for the particulars of their situation. But
  their names server should be usable by most software that makes use of
  Local Names. Hence, this spec.

  Examples of clients:
  * a wiki-like text-to-HTML converter, that supports Local Names
  * a web client redirection service, that fowards name lookups to URLs
  * an XML-RPC or SOAP interface, that uses Local Names to locate services
  * a CLI program, that returns URLs given names to look up
  * an IRC or Jabber bot, that gives the URLs associated with names
  * a script that relinks Local Names found in HTML to URLs

  Examples of servers:
  * a simple in-memory caching Local Names Query server
  * a Local Names Query server using SQL in the back
  * a Local Names Query server optimized for serving particular names
  * a Local Names Query server alternating responses to distribute load


  REQUIREMENTS
  ============

  * You're using v1.2 Local Names descriptions.

  That said, if the specified syntax does not change significantly
  in v1.3, v1.4, ..., this interface may work perfectly fine.

  It may even work as we transition to v2.0, provided that the data
  model does not change significantly.

  * You're using XML-RPC.

  This interface is readily adaptable to SOAP, though.


  OVERVIEW
  =============

  All functions are defined in the "lnquery" namespace. That is,
  if you have a function "foo" here, it's full name is "lnquery.foo".

  Functions are grouped into "Query" and "Admin," because it's
  convenient to think of them that way. But those groupings- They have
  no bearing on the code, or the actual interface implementation. The
  only reason we're grouping them like that is because it's easier to
  think of them this way.

  Query:
  * lnquery.lookup(ns_url, name)
  * lnquery.find(ns_url, path, record_type, style)
  * lnquery.find_many(ns_url, paths, record_type, style)

  Admin:
  * lnquery.get_server_info()
  * lnquery.get_cached_text(ns_url)
  * lnquery.dump_cache(ns_url)

  The Query part is what you use to perform Local Names queries.

  The Admin part is what you use to find out what resolution styles the
  interface supports, and to get information about the cache.

  The specification is soomewhat "loose." For example, there'a a
  "ns_url" in a lot of places.  You MUST include the arguments in the
  function signatures, but you don't have to actually use them. If you
  wanted to make a query server that programatically converted paths
  into URLs, and that did not make use of a namespace description to do
  so, you can do that.

  There is a section at the end of this document called
  "Considerations," which goes into some of these issues in
  detail. Another section, "Scenarios," describes how you might
  want to use the API, for different types of servers.

  Functions can produce errors; there's a section on "Error Codes"
  below. When the specification for a function says "return error code
  -201," it means to return the tuple (-201, "record not found").
  Again, see "Error Codes" below for more details.


  SPECIFICATION
  =============

    lnquery.lookup(ns_url, name)
    ----------------------------

  Lookup a single name within the named namespace, using the query
  server's default lookup style.

  It returns a string with the final URL in it.

  Can return error codes: -300


    lnquery.find(ns_url, path, record_type, style)
    ----------------------------------------------

  Lookup an entry.

  ns_url: (string) URL of the namespace description to find the name in
  path: (list of strings) the lookup path to follow
  record_type: "LN", "NS", "X", or "PATTERN"
  style: name of style to lookup, or "default" for the default style

  Lookup one path's result.

  Return a string value, appropriate to the query style, if it succeeds.

  Can return error codes: -200, -201, -202, -300, -301


    lnquery.find_many(ns_url, paths, record_type, style)
    ----------------------------------------------------

  This is the same as lnquery.find, only: Instead of accepting one path,
  it accepts a list of paths.

  And instead of returning a string or error, it returns a list of
  strings and errors, corresponding to the paths passed.


    lnquery.get_server_info()
    -------------------------

  Returns a description of the interface implementation.

  It returns a dictionary, the following keys MUST appear in it.

  * "INTERFACE"
      - MUST return the text: "v1 Local Names Query Interface"
  * "IMPLEMENTATION"
      - Returns some unique name identifying the code-base in use.
      - For example, "LION-LNQS-D1-V1", for Lion Kimbros' Local Names
        query server.
      - You can make this name up; Just don't collide with anyone else.
  * "CACHE"
      - Returns information about the cache.
      - A list of lists:
        [[preferred name of first namespace (string),
          URL of first namespace description (string),
          seconds until first namespaces' cache times out (integer)],
         [preferred name of second namespace,
          URL of second namespace,
          seconds until second namespaces' cache times out],
         ...
        ]
      - If an entry does not have a preferred name, return an empty
        string.
  * "STYLES"
      - Returns information about styles.
      - A list of lists:
        [[first style name (string),
          first style human readable description (string)],
         [second style name (string),
          second style human readable description (string)],
         ...
        ]
      - The first style is the default style.

  The server can send over any other information it wants to, as well:
  If you want a key-value pair in the returned dictionary that you don't
  see here, feel free to add it. You may want to tell Lion about what it
  is, though. If it's a pretty useful idea, in general, we can add it to
  the spec as a recommended key-value pair for consideration.

  The above keys MUST be defined, though.


    lnquery.get_cached_text(ns_url)
    ----------------------------

  The server returns it's cached version of the text at the given URL.

  This is very useful while debugging a server. It is also useful in
  emergency situations, when a namespace description has gone down.

  The text of the cached page is returned as one giant string.

  Can return error codes: -302


    lnquery.dump_cache(ns_url)
    --------------------------

  Cause the server to dump a namespace description from cache.

  Returns error code 0 on success.

  Can return error codes: -302


  ERROR CODES
  ===========

  All error codes are returned as tuples, of the following form:

    (error #, error string)

  The meanings of the error #'s follow. On a particular interface,
  you should use these error #'s. You should probably use these error
  strings as well, but they are more maleable. Your server may do
  something special, and perhaps a different error string would be
  better. You make the call.

    error #  string
          0  "OK"
         -1  "permission denied"
         -2  "not implemented"
         -3  "internal server error"
         -4  "(error custom to server - replace this text per-error)"
       -200  "bad record type- valid: LN, NS, X, PATTERN"
       -201  "record not found"
       -202  "insufficient PATTERN arguments"
       -300  "cannot read namespace description"
       -301  "unsupported style"
       -302  "not cached"

  (Error numbers are chosen to coincide with error numbers used by the
   Local Names XML-RPC Store Interface.)

  Error -4 deserves special note. If your server has some special
  error condition that it wants to tell the user about, use this
  code, and use the error string to tell the user whatever.

  Note also: The error string is really up to the server. If it wants
  to give additional information in the string, that's fine. For
  example, if the server wants to say, "-300, cannot read namespace
  description: This server only looks up local names within particular
  name spaces," that's okay.

  Error numbers are for client software to interpret.
  Error strings are for human presentation.

  Do not change the meanings of error numbers.
  You may change error strings.

  Clients, beware: errors -1. -2, -3, -4. They can crop up on any
  function, for any reason. Beware.


  CONSIDERATIONS
  ==============

  This section describes terms and details.


  LOOKUP PATH:

  A "lookup path" refers to the path followed to resolve a lookup
  query. The lookup path takes the form of a list of strings.

  Usually it works like so:

  ["...", "...", "...", ..., "...", "..."]
   |<------------+--------------->| |<->|
      namespace links               final name

  Lookup begins in one namespace, specified with a URL, outside the
  lookup path.

  The names of the namespaces ("namespace links,") label NS records to
  follow.  final name identifies the name of a record (a local name, a
  namespace link, a pattern link, or extension data) in the last
  namespace description.

  Why so vague? Why do I say "usually" instead of "always?"

  Because how a lookup path is used depends on the query style in use.

  Also, there's the special treatment of pattern links:

  ["...", "...", "...", ..., "...", "...", "...", "..."]
   |<------------+--------------->| |<->|  |<-------->|
      namespace links              pattern   pattern
                                    link    arguments

  If a pattern link is found in the lookup path, everything after it is
  treated as a pattern argument.


  QUERY STYLE:

  We have never settled on one way to resolve Local Names, given
  namespace descriptions, a starting namespace description, and a lookup
  path. Instead, we have left this open, and made some recommendations.

  An implementation of the Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface can
  support several different query styles. An interface implementation
  must support AT LEAST ONE query style.

  The details of what styles are supported, and what they are like, are
  provided by the lnquery.get_server_info method. The server need not
  return any details, though, meaning that the client must use the
  default query style ("default").

  "Reverse lookups," where a user wants to find the name associated with
  some URL in a given namespace, are implemented as query styles. See
  "traditional-R", defined below, for an example.

  Style identifiers are case insensitive strings.


  DEFAULT QUERY STYLE:

  "default" refers to the default query style.

  If a client has not been configured to point to a particular style, it
  must use "default" for the style argument.


  RELATIVE URL:

  Local names may bind names to relative URLs and pattern links may bind
  link keys to relative URL templates. If the URL begins with "http://",
  it is absolute. But if it does not, then it may be interpreted (by the
  query style) as relative.

  It's up to the query style how to handle a relative URL.

  The basic reltive URL handling behavior goes like so: Take the URL for
  the namespace description itself. Remove everything after the final
  slash (/). Append the relative URL to that.

  Note that the author is ignorant of the general form of URLs, and this
  behavior should comply with RFC specifications. This part of this
  specification is likely to change in the future as the author learns
  more.

  Example lookup:

  Lookup:                        example name
  URL of Namespace Description:  http://example.com/foo/description.txt
  Local name record found:       LN "example name" "bar/robots.txt"

  Basic behavior for handling relative URL:
  
  URL of Namespace Description:  http://example.com/foo/description.txt
  URL minus after slash:         http://example.com/foo/
  Final URL:                     http://example.com/foo/bar/robots.txt


  TRADITIONAL QUERY STYLES:

  This consideration describes the "Traditional Query Style," and the
  "Traditional Reverse Query Style." They are described here as both
  example and specification.

  They are called "traditional," because they are inspired by the way
  that the Old Style Local Names Query Server resolved queries, and the
  way the even older Local Names Query Server resolved queries.

  "traditional" - the Traditional Query Style

  1. Start from the namespace description found at the given URL
     (ns_url.) Start with the first name in the lookup path.

     If the starting namespace can't be found, return error -300.

  2. Is the current name the last name in the lookup path?

     YES: Look up the record of the specified record type (record_type.)
          First look by exact spelling. If it's not found, look second
          for a loose match. If there's still no match, look for an X
          FINAL record. Return the record. If it's an LN or NS or
          PATTERN or X FINAL with a relative URL, calculate the full URL
          and return it. If the specified record type is "PATTERN", send
          the URL template without substiting "$NAME." (If, however, an
          LN lookup defaulted to an X FINAL, substitute $NAME.) If the
          specified record type is "X", send the associated value list
          as a list of strings.

          "going deep": If there is no match (and no X FINAL, as a last
          resort for an LN lookup,) then we "go deep": For every
          namespace link, perform step 2 YES, again, in the target
          namespace. (However, we do not recursively go deep- the end
          result is that we have checked the last namespace, and all the
          namespaces that it is linked to.)

          If there is still no match, return error code -201.

     NO: (continue)

  3. Is there an NS record with this exact name?

     YES: transition to using the namespace described at the URL,
          transition to evaluating the next name in the lookup path, and
          go to step 2.

     NO: (continue)

  4. Is there a PATTERN record with this exact name?

     YES: If the URL template is a relative URL template, calculate the
          full URL template. Regardless, substitute the rest of the
          lookup path into the URL template as pattern arguments. Return
          the result as a string.
     
     NO: (continue)

  5. Is there an NS record with a loose match to this name?

     YES: (just like 3. YES)

     NO: (continue)

  6. Is there a PATTERN record with a loose match to this name, and is
     the next name the final name in the lookup path?

     YES: (just like 4. YES)

     NO: (continue)

  7. The next namespace couldn't be resolved. Time to return error code
     -201.

  What is a "loose match?" Compare the second column value with the
  given name performing the following conversions to both names before
  comparing:
  1. Ignore upper vs. lower case.
  2. Ignore anything that is not a letter or a number.
  3. Remove a trailing "s"
  4. Remove a trailing "ing"
  5. Remove a trailing "ed"
  6. If either name is blank, fail the match.


  "traditional-R" - the Traditional Reverse Query Style

  Load the namespace description. (Return error -300 on failure.) Look
  for a record of the given type, interpreting the name as a 3rd column
  value, rather than a 2nd column value. If an exact match is found,
  return it. If no exact match is found, search for a match ignoring
  case (but preserving everything else.)

  PATTERN records receive no special treatment. If a "$NAME" is in the
  URL template, than a "$NAME" must be passed to find the pattern key.
