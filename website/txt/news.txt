== 2005-06-21: Site Reworking, Interface Specification ==

The project has undergone a lot of changes! We are now much more focused
on [[Local Names interface] interfaces] and [[specs] specifications.]

We have specified the [[LNXRStoreI] Local Names XML-RPC Store
Interface,] and we are in the process of specifying the [[LNXRQueryI]
Local Names XML-RPC Query Interface;] The only thing we need, really, is
to figure out how we're going to report errors. So, it's almost done!

We're almost to the fun part: Writing code.


== 2004-12-12: Static Site Up ==

Okay! I'm working on setting up the Local Names static site.

It's not completely up yet; I'll create another newsmessage when it is.

This page is only for major changes and what not. For more
minute-by-minute details about what's going on, you'll have to
